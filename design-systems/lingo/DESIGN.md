# Design System Inspired by Lingo

> Category: Creative & Artistic
> Playful, minimal design with bright colors, rounded shapes, tactile 3D borders, and friendly illustrations for approachable interfaces.

## Overview

Playful, minimal design with bright colors, rounded shapes, tactile 3D borders, and friendly illustrations for approachable interfaces.

- **Visual style:** bold, playful
- **Color stance:** primary, neutral, success, warning, danger
- **Design intent:** Keep outputs recognizable to this style family while preserving usability and readability.

## Colors

- **Primary:** `#58CC02` — Token from style foundations.
- **Secondary:** `#CE82FF` — Token from style foundations.
- **Success:** `#58CC02` — Token from style foundations.
- **Warning:** `#FFC800` — Token from style foundations.
- **Danger:** `#FF4B4B` — Token from style foundations.
- **Surface:** `#FFFFFF` — Token from style foundations.
- **Text:** `#3C3C3C` — Token from style foundations.
- **Neutral:** `#FFFFFF` — Derived from the surface token for official format compatibility.

- Favor Primary (#58CC02) for CTA emphasis.
- Use Surface (#FFFFFF) for large backgrounds and cards.
- Keep body copy on Text (#3C3C3C) for legibility.

## Typography

- **Scale:** 12/14/16/20/24/32
- **Families:** primary=Nunito, display=Nunito, mono=JetBrains Mono
- **Weights:** 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900
- Headings should carry the style personality; body text should optimize scanability and contrast.

## Layout

- **Spacing scale:** 4/8/12/16/24/32
- Keep vertical rhythm consistent across sections and components.
- Align columns and modules to a predictable grid; avoid ad-hoc offsets.

### Layout & Composition

- Prefer clear content blocks with consistent internal padding.
- Keep hierarchy obvious: headline → support text → primary action.
- Use whitespace to separate concerns before adding borders or shadows.

## Components

- Buttons: primary action uses `#58CC02`; secondary actions stay neutral.
- Inputs: strong focus-visible states, clear labels, and predictable error messaging.
- Cards/sections: use consistent radii, spacing, and elevation strategy across the page.

## Do's and Don'ts

- Do not introduce off-palette colors when an existing token can solve the problem.
- Do not flatten hierarchy by using the same type size/weight for all text.
- Do not add decorative effects that reduce readability or accessibility.
- Do not mix unrelated visual metaphors in the same interface.

## Motion & Interaction

- Use subtle transitions that emphasize Primary (#58CC02) as the interaction signal.
- Default to short, purposeful transitions (150–250ms) with stable easing.
- Ensure hover, focus-visible, active, disabled, and loading states are explicit.

## Voice & Brand

- Tone should reflect the visual style: concise, confident, and product-specific.
- Keep microcopy action-oriented and avoid generic filler language.
- Preserve the style identity in headlines while keeping UI labels literal and clear.
